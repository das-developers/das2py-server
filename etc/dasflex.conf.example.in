# This server can send das streams over websocket frames.  To enable this
# functionality set the value of the WEBSOCKET_URI below to the *external*
# address of your websocket server.  For example:
# 
#   wss://jupiter.physics.uiowa.edu/das/nert/juno/wav/survey 
#
# The das2 websocket will typically sit behind a more secure webserver
# such as apache.  To do this first enable the apache2 proxy_wstunnel
# module:
#
#  sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
#
# Then name the path on your server to map to the das2 websocket server in
# your apache2 configuration:
#
#  <Location "/dasws/">
