# Das2 uses the 'tag' URI scheme (RFC-4151) to generate human readable, but
# globally unique data source paths.  These strings are not like DOIs.  They
# don't tag files, datests, or even servers, they identify das2 catalog
# navagation paths.
# 
# Your site is an independent head node in the catalog.  It thus needs an
# independent path tag. To keep the tag's short, try using the shortest
# domain name you can directly influence, and the oldest year for which
# you are confident there are no conflicting tags.  Here's an example:
#
#   SITE_PATH = tag:physics.uiowa.edu,2006
#
# In the example above, suppose that you could request DNS sub-entries for
# "physiscs.uiowa.edu" but for organizational reasons, not directly in
# "uiowa.edu".  In this case the even shorter tag:
#
#   tag:uiowa.edu,2006 
#
# would not meet the claim of ownership for the purposes of RFC-4151. 
# (To link into the global catalog see SITE_ID at the end of this file)

# Server ID, short lowercase string used to distinguish this server from
# others at the same site.  Will be combined with the site path, to make

#  SITE_PATH  = "tag:physics.uiowa.edu,2016"
#  SERVER_ID = "jupiter"
#
# Then all data source paths on this server with start with the prefix:
#
#    tag:physics.uiowa.edu,2016:jupiter:/

# There is a global das2 catalog that can be linked, either to your site
# as a whole if you have a site catalog, or directly to your das2 servers
# if you don't.  To request a link, either:
#
#    1) open an issue at  https://github.com/das-developers/das-cat
#    2) or send email to  das-developers@uiowa.edu.  
#
# The global catalog path root is:
#
#    tag:das2.org,2012
#
# This catalog object may be found at two urls for live fail-over:
#
#    http://das2.org/catalog/das.json
#    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/das-developers/das-cat/master/cat/das.json
#
# When linked into the federated das2 catalog, your data sources will 
# take on a second path tag.  For example a data source found through
# the site local path:
#
#   tag:physics.uiowa.edu,2006:/jupiter/juno/wav/survey
#
# will also be reachable using one of the paths:
#
#   tag:das2.org,2012:site:/SITE_ID/juno/wav/survey  (production)
#
#   tag:das2.org,2012:test:/SITE_ID/juno/wav/survey  (test sources)
#
# Use this option to set the ID you prefer.  
#
# Like SERVER_ID above, this should be a simple single token.  It only needs to
# be unique within the "tag:das2.org,2012" namespace.  Since space physics is
# not a huge community (compared to the Internet in general) there's no need to
# use an elaborate site ID.  Here's a few examples of picking good ones based
# on organizational URLs:
# 
#   Organization URL              SITE_ID
#   --------------------------    -------
#   jsoc.swri.org                  swri

#   ufa.cas.cz                     ufa_cas
#   voparis-maser-das.obspm.fr     obspm
# 
# For documentation (if nothing else) set this to the site ID you received
# when linking to the federated catalog

# SITE_ID = mysite
