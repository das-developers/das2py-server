The password strings are maintained by the htpasswd command:

1. To set your password, or create a das2 Account if you don't have one:

  htpasswd -d %(PREFIX)s/etc/passwd USERNAME
  
  Currently the das2-pyserver only understands the crypt hash, thus the
  '-d' option is needed.
  
2. To remove an account:

  htpasswd -D %(PREFIX)s/etc/passwd USERNAME
  
In the future the code for htpasswd will be modified to create a 
das2passwd program, that accounts for user email addresses.
