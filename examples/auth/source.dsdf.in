; This is a DSDF file.  DSDF files define data sources.  A data source is 
; simply a program that the server can invoke to produce data over a given
; parameter range.  Since das2 pyserver invokes external reader programs to
; generate data, it does not matter what type of files the data are stored in
; nor which computer language is used to create the readers.  As long as reader
; programs write a usable stream to standard output they will plug into the
; overall server.  In fact this data source doesn't read any files at all.
;
; Programs provided with the server may operate on your data stream before
; it's provided to the end client.  For example, the program das2_bin_avgsec
; reads a das2 stream on it's input and produces an output stream with 
; reduced time resolution.  Another program, das2_psd calculates the power
; spectral density of an input das2 stream and writes the transformed stream
; to it's standard output.  Multiple manipulations may be chained together,
; but they all start with a your data reader programs, not data files.
;
; The following example DSDF and it's associated reader provide 200 random
; points in the given interval between -10 and +10.
