; Dependency Note
; ---------------
; The reader for this data source requires the following libraries:
;
;   1. The CDF library at:  https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/
;   2. The spacepy library at:  https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy/
;
; Version 3.7.1 of libcdf removed a functions available in libcdf 3.7.0 that
; spacepy depended upon for Epoch time handling.   If you cannot compatable
; versions of spacepy and libcdf on your server, workaround libraries are 
; included in the examples area but are not installed by setup.py.  
;
; Read the "fallback_pycdf.txt" file for details.


; CDF Example Data Source with Parameters
;
; The following example DSDF and it's associated reader provide autocorrelation
; and cross correlation electric and magnetic wave measurements from THEMIS
; CDF spectral matrix files.  These files have many different measurements
; that may be output.  In addition the reader can preform some internal 
; calculations on the data as well.  Controlling these options is handled by
; a third argument to the reader call 'params'.  Params are not required and
; readers should work without them.
