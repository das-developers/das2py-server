; This is a DSDF file.  DSDF files define data sources.  A data source is 
; simply a program that the server can invoke to produce data over a given
; parameter range in a usable format such as a Das2 stream or a QStream.  Since
; the Das2 system is defined in terms of interfaces between programs, it does
; not matter what computer language is used to create your data producers.
; As long as they write a usable stream to standard output they will plug
; into the overall server.
;
; Programs provided with the server may operate on your data stream before
; it's provided to the end client.  For example, the program das2_bin_avgsec
; reads a Das2 stream on it's input and produces an output stream with 
; reduced time resolution.  Another program, das2_psd calculates the power
; spectral density of an input Das2 stream and writes the transformed stream
; to it's standard output.  Multiple manipulations may be chained together,
; but they all start with a your data reader programs, not data files.
;
; The following example DSDF and it's associated reader provide wideband
; low-frequency electric field waveforms collected by Voyager 1 while
; crossing Jupiter's bow-shock in the solar wind.


; All Data sources must have a one-line description

description = 'Uncalibrated Voyager 1 PWS Wideband waveforms (Sample Dataset)'


; Summaries are optional, but encouraged.  The example below demonstrates
; multi-line strings

summary = 'Raw Voyager PWS 4-bit waveform values.  Without correlating '+$
          'information it is not possible to calibrate these data into '+$
          'physical units as an on board automated gain control system '+$
          'adjusted input attenuation to keep signals within a measurable '+$
          'sensitivity range.  In addition, the PWS instrument had no '+$
			 'mechanism for transmitting these gain settings to the spacecraft '+$
			 'computer.'


; Any Bourne shell compatible command may be used below.  The server will 
; automatically add up to three arguments on the command line after 
; the reader, they are, in order:  START_TIME  STOP_TIME  EXTRA_PARAMETERS
; The first two are always given, the third is only provided if supplied
; by the end-user client program (such as Autoplot)

reader = '/usr/bin/env PYTHONPATH=%(PREFIX)s/lib/python%(PYVER)s python%(PYVER)s %(PREFIX)s/examples/waveform.py %(PREFIX)s/examples/vgr_data'


; The default reducer simply outputs bin averages, which are not suitable
; for waveform data.  Here we tell the server that it should not pipe the
; output of this reader through a reducer program.

reducer = 'not_reducible'


; This reader produces data as a das2Stream.  QStreams may also be used
; but these are not understood by das2_cache_rdr and das2_psd

das2Stream = 1


; Technical contacts should know how to fix software or data issues with this
; data source.  All data sources must provide a technical contact email.

; Scientific Contact, these are not required but highly encouraged.

; Autoplot will display example ranges in a drop-down menu when loading 
; data.  Up to 100 examples may be listed (00 through 99)
; For this small dataset we are just taking the whole range as the
; example.
