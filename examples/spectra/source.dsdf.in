; This is a DSDF file.  DSDF files define data sources.  A data source is 
; simply a program that the server can invoke to produce data over a given
; parameter range in a usable format such as a das2 stream or a QStream.  Since
; the das2 system is defined in terms of interfaces between programs, it does
; not matter what computer language is used to create your data producers.
; As long as they write a usable stream to standard output they will plug
; into the overall server.
;
; Programs provided with the server may operate on your data stream before
; it's provided to the end client.  For example, the program das2_bin_avgsec
; reads a Das2 stream on it's input and produces an output stream with 
; reduced time resolution.  Another program, das2_psd calculates the power
; spectral density of an input Das2 stream and writes the transformed stream
; to it's standard output.  Multiple manipulations may be chained together,
; but they all start with a your data reader programs, not data files.
;
; The following example DSDF and it's associated reader provide wideband
; low-frequency electric field waveforms collected by Voyager 1 while
; crossing Jupiter's bow-shock in the solar wind.


; All Data sources must have a one-line description

description = 'Uncalibrated Voyager 1 PWS Wideband dynamic spectra (Sample Dataset)'


; Summaries are optional, but encouraged.  The example below demonstrates
; multi-line strings

summary = 'Dynamic spectra generated from the Waveform_Example data source '+$
          'see the summary of the Wavform_Example data source for more '+$
			 'information.'


; Any Bourne shell compatible command may be used below.  The server will 
; automatically add up to three arguments on the command line after 
; the reader, they are, in order:  START_TIME  STOP_TIME  EXTRA_PARAMETERS
; The first two are always given, the third is only provided if supplied
; by the end-user client program (such as Autoplot)

reader = 'env PYTHONPATH=%(PREFIX)s/lib/python%(PYVER)s %(PREFIX)s/examples/spectra.sh'


; This dataset is able to use the default reducer, das2_bin_avgsec
; thus the reducer directive is not needed here.
; reducer = das2_bin_avgsec


; The output of this reader comes from das2_psd and is thus a das2Stream

das2Stream = 1


; Technical contacts should know how to fix software or data issues with this
; data source.  All data sources must provide a technical contact email.

techContact = 'Your Name <your.name@yourplace.edu>'


; Scientific Contact, these are not required but highly encouraged.

sciContact = 'Some Scientist <some.scientist@yourplace.edu>'


; Max time range values that will be accepted by das2 pyserver, requests
; outside this range will be trimmed.

validRange = '1979-03-01T12:26:11 to 1979-03-01T12:29:24 UTC'


; Autoplot will display example ranges in a drop-down menu when loading 
; data.  Up to 100 examples may be listed (00 through 99)
; For this small dataset we are just taking the whole range as the
; example.

exampleRange_00 = '1979-03-01T12:26:11 to 1979-03-01T12:29:24 | Bow shock crossing'


; This reader can take extra parameters in the optional third argument.
; These can be used to change how the dynamic spectrum is calculated.
; These are described below.  When using Autoplot as the client these
; descriptions are visible to the end user, but are somewhat cluncky at
; this point.

param_00 = 'DFT_LEN | The length of each transform, defaults to 800'
param_01 = 'DFT_SLIDE | The denominator of the overlap fraction, defaults to 2 (i.e. 1/2 overlap)'

; The output of this reader may be cached at various resolution to allow
; for rapid graphical navigation.  The line below states that the server
; may generate daily files containing data averaged over 10 second time
; bins.  Since no special reducer is listed for this source, the default
; reducer will be used to generate the cache files.

cacheLevel_00 = '250 ms | hourly'
cacheLevel_10 = '1 s | daily'


; Enable HAPI format conversion if desired
