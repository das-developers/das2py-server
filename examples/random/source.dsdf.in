; This is a DSDF file.  It can be read by the source compiler, das2_srv_sdef, to
; generate a data source definitions for various APIs.
;
; To create a internal and external source definitions from this file run:
;
;    export PYTHONPATH=%(PREFIX)s/lib/python%(PYVER)s 
;    %(PREFIX)s/bin/das2_srv_sdef source.dsdf         
;
; 
; A data source is simply a program that the server can invoke to produce data
; over a given.  Since th server invokes external reader programs to generate data,
; it does not matter what type of files the data are stored in nor which computer
; language is used to create the readers.  As long as reader programs write a usable
; stream to standard output they will plug into the overall server.  In fact this
; data source doesn't read any files at all.
;
; Programs provided with the server may operate on your data stream before
; it's provided to the end client.  For example, the program das2_bin_avgsec
; reads a das2 stream on it's input and produces an output stream with 
; reduced time resolution.  Another program, das2_psd calculates the power
; spectral density of an input das2 stream and writes the transformed stream
; to it's standard output.  Multiple manipulations may be chained together,
; but they all start with a your data reader programs, not data files.
;
; This definition is for a reader which provides 200 random points in a given
; interval between -10 and +10.
